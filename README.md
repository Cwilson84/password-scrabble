# <Password Scrabble>

## Module Three Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to modify starter code and define a function to generate a random password meeting specific, semi-optional, criteria.  The acceptance critera were as folows:

- On button click generate a password;
- Followed by a series of prompts for password criteria;
- Upon prompt allow user to select which criteria to include (optional);
- Provided the length be from 8 to 128 characters and the characters be of one or more categories (semi);
- Categories include uppercase and lowercase letters as well as numbers 0 to 9 and select special characters;
- Category adherence is validated (you must include one or more) for funtion to operate;
- Length adherence is validated (you must choose a numeral in range) for funtion to operate;
- Upon completion a random password is generated matching all chosen criteria and written to the page;

While exploring the function of this little project program, one may also find several little additions that were for fun as much as function, including:
 
- Addition of a name prompt with some fun function whether left blank or used appropriately;
- Alert windows with custom error message;
- Personal error message written to screen in place of password on function fail with cause where applicable; 
I had a lot of fun with this on.  Mostly from the inspiration to play with the code, through frustration, but also learning...well the *function* of functions.  Having to go back and forth, experiment with the "best" way...I learned a great deal and I genuinely enjoyed failing at getting what I wanted until I didn't.

## Credits

[W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com), [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) and, of course, [Google](https://www.google.com) had me in moments of "Why won't you do what you should do here".  If you guessed I was wrong, yup.  That said, doing this in this way was a learning experience I didnt expect, and I feel much more confident in my ability to find different solutions to problems.  I solved this in two similar but differnt ways (one big array || if else bonanza) before finding the way that gave me what I wanted, plus what was requried (ONE array to rule them all).  Did I mention I had fun with this one? Function. Meow.
